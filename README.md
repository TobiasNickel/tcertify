this project will consist of multiple parts.
1. sdk to work with certificates
2. server implementation that will allow to manage certificates and allow clients to manage there certificates.
3. client that uses a server to support its keyexchange.
4. an example chat application for using the certificates and end to end encryption.

The sdk is for developer to handle certificates on different types od devices.
The server will provide appopriate functionality to support enterprice grade security, authentication, encryption and keyExchange.
The client will demonstrate how the server can be used to secure keyexchange for clients.
